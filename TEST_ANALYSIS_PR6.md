---

### Phase 2: Breaking Changes Impact Assessment

#### 2.1 express-jwt API Migration Testing

**Critical Breaking Change:** API structure completely changed from v0.1.3 to v8.4.1

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
// OLD API (v0.1.3) - DEPRECATED
app.use(expressJwt({ secret: publicKey }))

// NEW API (v8.4.1) - REQUIRED
app.use(expressJwt({ 
  secret: publicKey, 
  algorithms: ['RS256'],
  credentialsRequired: true 
}))
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Verify all JWT middleware configurations updated
- [ ] Test JWT token validation with new API
- [ ] Confirm error handling works correctly
- [ ] Validate algorithm restrictions are enforced

#### 2.2 jsonwebtoken API Migration Testing

**Breaking Change:** Enhanced security options and stricter validation

**Test Cases:**
```typescript
// OLD API (v0.4.0)
jwt.sign(payload, secret)
jwt.verify(token, secret)

// NEW API (v9.0.2) - Enhanced Security
jwt.sign(payload, secret, { 
  algorithm: 'RS256', 
  expiresIn: '1h',
  issuer: 'juice-shop',
  audience: 'juice-shop-users'
})
jwt.verify(token, secret, { 
  algorithms: ['RS256'],
  issuer: 'juice-shop',
  audience: 'juice-shop-users'
})
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Test JWT token generation with new options
- [ ] Verify token validation with algorithm restrictions
- [ ] Test token expiration handling
- [ ] Confirm issuer/audience validation

---

### Phase 3: Security Vulnerability Testing

#### 3.1 JWT Security Testing

**Test Cases:**
```javascript
// Test 1: Algorithm Confusion Attack (Should FAIL)
const maliciousToken = jwt.sign(payload, publicKey, { algorithm: 'HS256' })

// Test 2: None Algorithm Bypass (Should FAIL)
const bypassToken = jwt.sign(payload, '', { algorithm: 'none' })

// Test 3: Key Confusion Attack (Should FAIL)
const confusedToken = jwt.sign(payload, wrongKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' })
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå Algorithm confusion attacks should be blocked
- ‚ùå None algorithm bypass should be prevented
- ‚ùå Key confusion attacks should fail validation
- ‚úÖ Only valid RS256 tokens should be accepted

#### 3.2 XSS Protection Testing

**Test Cases:**
```javascript
// Test 1: Script Tag Injection (Should be sanitized)
const xssPayload1 = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'

// Test 2: Event Handler XSS (Should be sanitized)
const xssPayload2 = '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')">'

// Test 3: JavaScript URL (Should be sanitized)
const xssPayload3 = '<a href="javascript:alert(\'XSS\')">Click</a>'

// Test 4: Data URI XSS (Should be sanitized)
const xssPayload4 = '<iframe src="data:text/html,<script>alert(\'XSS\')</script>"></iframe>'
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All script tags should be removed/escaped
- ‚úÖ Event handlers should be stripped
- ‚úÖ JavaScript URLs should be blocked
- ‚úÖ Dangerous data URIs should be sanitized

#### 3.3 YAML Injection Testing

**Test Cases:**
```yaml
# Test 1: Code Injection (Should FAIL)
!!js/function >
  function() { require('child_process').exec('rm -rf /'); }

# Test 2: Prototype Pollution (Should FAIL)
__proto__:
  isAdmin: true

# Test 3: Constructor Pollution (Should FAIL)
constructor:
  prototype:
    isAdmin: true
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå Code injection attempts should be blocked
- ‚ùå Prototype pollution should be prevented
- ‚ùå Constructor manipulation should fail
- ‚úÖ Only safe YAML parsing should succeed
